 ## Built with         
      -HTML(Hypertext Mark-up Language)
      -CSS(Cascading Styles Sheet)
      -BOOTSTRAP
      -JS(Java-script)


 ## My Challanges and lessons
Learnt how to use bootstrap classes and terminologies, practised grids effectly, with equal distribution of sections.The javascript was quite tasking,but with careful concentration it was fun.

##Hover-effects##
Hover-effects are really useful syntax in css, it creates a little interaction between the user, coupled with a little animation, which improves the structure and movement on the website.

 ## Best syntax Used
    ``CSS
 (CSS grids, flex-box, box-shadow, and float).I really had fun with these syntax.The grids helped out in the complex layout of sections, while the flex-box and float helped with the placing of items adequately to prevent work from collapsing.
