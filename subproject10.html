                        <p class="lead">
                            A father is the male parent of a child. Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his
                            children,
                            the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries
                            with
                            it certain rights and obligations. An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's
                            parent through the legal process of adoption. A biological father is the male genetic
                            contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation.A
                            biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an
                            obligation
                            of monetary support. A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is
                            alleged but has not been established. A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's
                            mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and
                            responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.

                        <p class="lead">
                            Motherhood, as defined here, is the cultural process of locating women's identities in their
                            capacity to nurture infants and children. As a set of concepts it dates only from the late
                            eighteenth century or the early nineteenth century in Europe. English dictionaries do not
                            make
                            these distinctions, yet "motherhood" can be differentiated from mothering, actually caring
                            for
                            children, and also from the biological events, pregnancy, birth, and lactation, associated
                            with
                            maternity. The panorama of changing discourses and practices offered by social history
                            vividly
                            demonstrates the error of conflating motherhood, mothering, and maternity.

                            Early childhood follows the infancy stage and begins with toddlerhood when the child begins
                            speaking or taking steps independently. While toddlerhood ends around age when the child
                            becomes
                            less dependent on parental assistance for basic needs, early childhood continues

                            until the age of . However, according to the National Association for the Education of Young
                            Children, early childhood also includes infancy. At this stage children are learning through
                            observing, experimenting and communicating with others. Adults supervise and support the
                            development process of the child, which then will lead to the child's autonomy. Also during
                            this
                            stage, a strong emotional bond is created between the child and the care providers. The
                            children
                            also start preschool and kindergarten at this age: and hence their social lives.

                                Middle childhood begins at around age 7, approximating primary school age. It ends with
                                puberty (around age 12 or 13), which typically marks the beginning of adolescence. In
                                this
                                period, children develop socially and mentally. They are at a stage where they make new
                                friends and gain new skills, which will enable them to become more independent and

                                their individuality. During middle childhood, children enter the school years, where

                                are presented with a different setting than they are used to. This new setting creates

                        <p class="lead">
                            This , the process whereby an individual learns to adjust to a group (or society) and behave
                            in
                            a manner approved by the group (or society). According to most social scientists,
                            socialization
                            essentially represents the whole process of learning throughout the life course and is a
                            central
                            influence on the behaviour, beliefs, and actions of adults as well as of
                            children.Socialization
                            is the process whereby an individual’s standards, skills, motives, attitudes, and behaviors
                            change to conform to those regarded as desirable and appropriate for his or her present and
                            future role in any particular society. Many agents play a role in the socialization process
                            including families, peers, neighborhoods, the mass media, schools, and religious
                            institutions.
                            It is assumed that these various agents function together rather than independently.
                            Families
                            have been recognized as an early pervasive and highly influential context for socialization.
                            Infants and children are dependent on parents for nurturance and support from an early age,
                            which accounts, in part, for their prominence as a socialization agent.Click <a
